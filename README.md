## Introduction

The Personalized Wireshark GUI project aims to simplify the learning process of network protocol analysis by providing a user-friendly graphical interface. Traditional tools like Wireshark can be overwhelming for beginners due to their complexity and extensive feature sets. This project addresses this issue by offering a streamlined interface that focuses on the core aspects of TCP, UDP, and IP protocols, making it ideal for educational purposes.

Built using Python and the Tkinter library, the GUI allows users to visualize with network protocol headers in an intuitive manner. Each protocol's header format is displayed with clear, labeled fields, enabling users to understand the structure and function of each component. By interacting with these visualizations, learners can gain a deeper understanding of how data is transmitted over networks.

The application is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, requiring minimal setup. It provides a hands-on learning experience, making complex networking concepts accessible to students, educators, and anyone interested in network analysis. Whether you are a computer science student, a network engineer in training, or simply someone interested in understanding network protocols, this tool offers a valuable resource for enhancing your knowledge.

## Features
